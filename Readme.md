# Go Programming Course: Income Expenses Tracker

Welcome to the 5-week Go Programming Course! In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of Go (Golang) by building a terminal-based Income Expenses Tracker. Each week, we'll cover specific topics and incrementally develop the project.

## Course Overview

### Week 1: Introduction to Go & Setting Up Environment
**Topic:**
- Introduction to Go
- Setting Up a Go Development Environment

**Instruction (1 hour):**
- Overview of Go and its features
- Installing Go
- Setting up IDE/text editor
- Writing and running a "Hello, World!" program

**Student Work:**
- Install Go and set up development environment
- Write and run your first Go program
- Start project: Create `main.go` file

### Week 2: Go Syntax, Data Types, and Control Structures
**Topic:**
- Go Syntax and Data Types
- Control Structures (If, For, Switch)

**Instruction (1 hour):**
- Variables, constants, and basic data types
- Arithmetic and logical operators
- If statements, for loops, switch statements
- Basic input/output

**Student Work:**
- Implement basic menu system for the project
- Create variables for storing income and expenses
- Write simple input validation using control structures

### Week 3: Functions and Collections
**Topic:**
- Functions in Go
- Working with Collections (Arrays, Slices, Maps)

**Instruction (1 hour):**
- Defining and calling functions
- Parameters and return values
- Arrays, slices, and maps
- Iterating over collections

**Student Work:**
- Create functions for adding income and expenses
- Implement a slice to store transactions
- Use a map to categorize expenses
- Write a function to display transaction history

### Week 4: Structs, Interfaces, and Error Handling
**Topic:**
- Structs and Interfaces
- Error Handling

**Instruction (1 hour):**
- Defining and using structs
- Creating and implementing interfaces
- Error creation and handling
- Panic and recover

**Student Work:**
- Define `Transaction` struct and related interfaces
- Implement error handling for user inputs
- Create custom errors for the project
- Refactor existing code to use new structs and error handling

### Week 5: File I/O and Concurrency
**Topic:**
- Basic File I/O
- Introduction to Concurrency in Go (Goroutines and Channels)

**Instruction (1 hour):**
- Reading from and writing to files
- Introduction to goroutines
- Basic channel usage
- Concurrent patterns in Go

**Student Work:**
- Implement saving and loading data to/from a file
- Add a concurrent auto-save feature using goroutines
- Create a simple real-time calculation feature using channels
- Finalize and test the complete Income Expenses program

## Project: Income Expenses Tracker

Throughout this course, you will build a terminal-based Income Expenses Tracker. This project will help you apply the concepts you learn each week.

### Project Structure

main.go // Main program logic and menu
transaction.go // Transaction struct and interfaces
operations.go // Functions for adding, removing, and calculating transactions
fileio.go // Functions for saving and loading data
concurrency.go // Concurrent features like auto-save or real-time calculations


### Features
- Add, view, and categorize income and expenses
- Save and load transaction data from a file
- Implement error handling for robust input validation
- Use concurrency for real-time calculations or auto-save features

By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of Go programming and a functional Income Expenses Tracker to showcase your skills.

Happy coding!
